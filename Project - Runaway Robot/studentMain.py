# ----------
# Background
# 
# A robotics company named Trax has created a line of small self-driving robots 
# designed to autonomously traverse desert environments in search of undiscovered
# water deposits.
#
# A Traxbot looks like a small tank. Each one is about half a meter long and drives
# on two continuous metal tracks. In order to maneuver itself, a Traxbot can do one
# of two things: it can drive in a straight line or it can turn. So to make a 
# right turn, A Traxbot will drive forward, stop, turn 90 degrees, then continue
# driving straight.
#
# This series of questions involves the recovery of a rogue Traxbot. This bot has 
# gotten lost somewhere in the desert and is now stuck driving in an almost-circle: it has
# been repeatedly driving forward by some step size, stopping, turning a certain 
# amount, and repeating this process... Luckily, the Traxbot is still sending all
# of its sensor data back to headquarters.
#
# In this project, we will start with a simple version of this problem and 
# gradually add complexity. By the end, you will have a fully articulated
# plan for recovering the lost Traxbot.
# 
# ----------
# Part One
#
# Let's start by thinking about circular motion (well, really it's polygon motion
# that is close to circular motion). Assume that Traxbot lives on 
# an (x, y) coordinate plane and (for now) is sending you PERFECTLY ACCURATE sensor 
# measurements. 
#
# With a few measurements you should be able to figure out the step size and the 
# turning angle that Traxbot is moving with.
# With these two pieces of information, you should be able to 
# write a function that can predict Traxbot's next location.
#
# You can use the robot class that is already written to make your life easier. 
# You should re-familiarize yourself with this class, since some of the details
# have changed. 
#
# ----------
# YOUR JOB
#
# Complete the estimate_next_pos function. You will probably want to use
# the OTHER variable to keep track of information about the runaway robot.
#
# ----------
# GRADING
# 
# We will make repeated calls to your estimate_next_pos function. After
# each call, we will compare your estimated position to the robot's true
# position. As soon as you are within 0.01 stepsizes of the true position,
# you will be marked correct and we will tell you how many steps it took
# before your function successfully located the target bot.

# These import steps give you access to libraries which you may (or may
# not) want to use.

# This is the function you have to write. The argument 'measurement' is a 
# single (x, y) point. This function will have to be called multiple
# times before you have enough information to accurately predict the
# next position. The OTHER variable that your function returns will be 
# passed back to your function the next time it is called. You can use
# this to keep track of important information over time.
